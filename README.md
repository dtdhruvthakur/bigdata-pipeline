*Setting up Imply (Druid, Tranquility, Plywood, Pivot) on AWS Instance*

1. Change directories to the location of the private key file (.pem file) that was used to launch the instance.
2. Use the chmod command to ensure private key file isnâ€™t public. 
  * Ex: `chmod 400 /path-to/pipeline.pem`
3. ssh into your instance. Specify .pem file as well as your unique public DNS name, shown below.
  * Sample ssh command: `ssh -i /path-to/pipeline.pem your-public-dns.computer.amazonaws.com`
4. If the instance asks if you are sure you want to continue connecting, enter yes.
5. To run Druid, Tranquility and all the other associated tools, we need Java 8 JDK. Check if Java 8 JDK is installed on your instance. (`java -version`)
6. If not, visit:  [Java JDK Download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) to find the appropriate Java JDK. Accept the License Agreement, but instead of downloading onto your local machine, right-click and copy the link of the download. 
7. Install and cd into the Imply package
  * `curl -O http://static.imply.io/release/imply-1.3.0.tar.gz`
  * `tar -xzf imply-1.3.0.tar.gz`
  * `cd imply-1.3.0`
8. Check that you have the following packages: 
  * bin/*, conf/*, conf-quickstart/*, dist/*, quickstart/*
9. Exit the Imply directory. 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
